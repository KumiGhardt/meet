# **Kumi's Meet App**


## Objective
To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
test-driven development (TDD) technique

## Key Features:
● Filter events by city.
● Show/hide event details.
● Specify number of events.
● Use the app when offline.
● Add an app shortcut to the home screen.
● View a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city.

##### In this app, the user should:

● be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events that
take place in that city.
●  be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less
information about an event.
● be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so
that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.
● to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I
viewed the last time I was online.
● be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I can
open the app faster.
● be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so
that I know what events are organized in which city
